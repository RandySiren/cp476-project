<p>
  The Internet Discussion Board (called IDB from here on out) is a web application written in ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS
  and MongoDB providing users an opportunity to interact with one another. The app aims to provide anyone who be re-used
  and setup with their own database/server to host and create their own discussion board as a general all in one use
  template. Simplicity and lightweight yet nice to look at is the aim of the final product.
</p>
<h2 id="problem-solving-and-algorithms">2. Problem Solving and Algorithms</h2>
<p>The IDB will be broken up into problems categorized under Database, Backend Architechture and Design</p>
<p>Database: Storing users, storing posts of users, relationally storing which post has which subcomments, user data</p>
<p>
  Backend Architechture: REST endpoints and organization of CRUD operations, how to move around our data for each user
  efficiently without loading everything, deploying backend
</p>
<p>Design: A clean and simple design for any devices which also looks pleasing.</p>
